# ModdersItems
 A collection of custom Risk of Rain 2 items based off of community modders, much like how vanilla has developer items.

# Contributing
This mod is a [ThunderKit Project](https://github.com/PassivePicasso/ThunderKit), and also makes use of [Moonstorm Shared Utils](https://thunderstore.io/package/TeamMoonstorm/MoonstormSharedUtils/) to handle the project.

Contribution can be done through forking this project and creating a [pull request](https://github.com/Vale-X/ModdersItems/pulls) between this project and the fork, much like R2API. Please follow the folder structure within the Unity Project, using your name for folders within the `AssetBundle`, `Scripts`, and `Source` folders. Adding any Defs to the content pack `MIContentPack` is required and must be done manually.
The `TokenBase` class is used to add your own set of tokens to the game, and was made for this project. Check out `ValeTokens` for example usage.

For an example of an item, check out the `Vale` folders within `AssetBundle`, `Scripts` and `Source`. (Item works but is WIP).
